SymptomNet is a revolutionary healthcare platform that combines blockchain technology with advanced AI to democratize medical diagnostics globally.

Our Solana-based smart contract allows medical professionals worldwide to submit and verify symptom-disease relationships, creating a secure, transparent database of medical knowledge. Doctors earn SYMPT tokens by contributing valuable records and verifying others' submissions, ensuring data quality through decentralized peer review.

This verified medical data trains our specialized agentic AI, which can interpret symptoms and suggest possible conditions based on knowledge from medical professionals across diverse geographical regions and specialties.

Users subscribe to SymptomNet's AI service to receive preliminary diagnostic insights by simply describing their symptoms, accessing a global knowledge base of medical expertise previously unavailable to most healthcare systems.

The platform bridges geographical healthcare disparities while incentivizing medical knowledge sharing through blockchain technology.
